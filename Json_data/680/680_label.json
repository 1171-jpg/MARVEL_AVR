    "Distrator": "white",
    "Perception_Answer": "black",
    "Demonstration": "The puzzle showcases a sequence of grids, each grid alternates the position of the black shapes between the leftmost side and the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, while the shape of the black figures changes in each grid, following the order of square, circle, triangle, and star.\nLet's analyze the pattern in the given sequence:\nIn the first grid, the two leftmost squares are black, while the other squares are white.\nIn the second grid, the two circles along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal are black, while the other circles are white.\nIn the third grid, the two leftmost triangles are black, while the other triangles are white.\nIn the fourth grid, the two stars along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal are black, while the other stars are white.\nBased on this pattern, the missing grid should have the two leftmost shapes in black, only choice 2 matches this pattern.",
