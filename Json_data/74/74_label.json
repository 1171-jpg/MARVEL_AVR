The question part on the top is a set of visual panels arranged in a 1 by 5 sequence, with the last piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?",
    "explanation": "The number of faces in the question stem figure is 1, 2, 3, and 4, so there are 5 faces at ?, and both items C and D have 4 faces, so they are excluded. Comparing items A and B, it is found that the polyline opening of item A is facing downward, and the polyline opening of item B is upward. The opening directions of the polyline of the question stem are up, down, up, and down, so the polyline of the graph at ? should be opened upward.",
