    "Perception_Answer": "two",
    "Demonstration": "Let's analyze the pattern in the given sequence, focusing on the number and arrangement of lines in each shape:\nThe first shape is a pentagon with five lines.\nThe second shape is a square with four lines, formed by removing the top line from the previous pentagon.\nThe third shape is a V-shape with three lines, formed by removing the left line from the previous square.\nThe fourth shape has two lines, formed by removing the bottom line from the previous V-shape.\nTherefore, to complete the pattern, the next shape should be formed by removing the right line from the previous two lines, resulting in a single vertical line in choice 1.",
