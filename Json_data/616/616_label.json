    "Perception_Answer": "longer",
    "Demonstration": "The given puzzle presents a sequence of shapes arranged in a 3x2 matrix, with shapes rotating in the first row and shapes transforming in the second row. The task is to discern the progression within each row and identify the correct shape to complete the sequence.\nLet's analyze the pattern in the first row:\nThe first shape is a circle with an open segment facing top-right.\nIn the second shape, the open segment has rotated 90 degrees clockwise to face bottom-right.\nIn the third shape, the open segment has rotated another 90 degrees clockwise to face bottom-left.\nFrom this, we can deduce that each subsequent shape in the top row rotates the open segment by 90 degrees clockwise.\nNow, applying this rotational pattern to the second row:\nThe first shape in the second row is a trapezoid.\nThe second shape appears to be the same trapezoid, rotated 90 degrees clockwise, which results in a parallelogram.\nFollowing this pattern, the third shape should be the parallelogram rotated another 90 degrees clockwise. The choice 2 is correct answer.",
