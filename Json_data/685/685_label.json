    "Demonstration": "The puzzle features a 3x2 grid of shapes, where each row follows a specific pattern based on the arrangement and fill of the shapes. \nLet's analyze the pattern in the given rows. In the first row, all grids contain three circles:\nThe first grid contains three circles, with the color pattern white, black, and striped from the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.\nThe second grid contains three circles, with the color pattern black, striped, and white from the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.\nThe third grid contains three circles, with the color pattern striped, white, and black from the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.\nIn the second row, all grids contain three rectangles:\nThe first grid contains three rectangles, with the color pattern white, black, and striped from the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.\nThe second grid contains three rectangles, with the color pattern black, striped, and white from the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.\nTherefore, the third grid should contain three rectangles, with the color pattern striped, white, and black from the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.\nAmong the four choices provided, only choice 4 matches the expected color pattern of striped, white, and black rectangles from the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.",
