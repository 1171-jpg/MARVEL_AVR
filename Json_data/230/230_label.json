Observe that in the first row of graphics, the outer small black ball moves one edge clockwise each time, the inner small black ball moves one square counterclockwise each time in the second row, and the outer small black ball moves clockwise each time. On the two sides, the inner small black ball moves two spaces counterclockwise each time; in the third row, according to the first two pictures, it can be seen that the outer small black ball moves three sides clockwise each time, and the inner small black ball moves three spaces counterclockwise each time. .
