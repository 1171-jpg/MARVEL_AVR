    "Explanation": "This question is a group question classification. It is observed that the elements have the same composition, and the positional rules are given priority. Observe the positional relationship between the small black dot and the triangular triangle. You can consider the black dot to draw the clock hand closest to the direction of the triangle. It is found that Figure 145 is clockwise and 236 is clockwise. That is, Figure 5 is obtained by rotating the same figure, and Figure 236 is obtained by rotating the same figure. Therefore, 145 is a group and 236 is a group.",
