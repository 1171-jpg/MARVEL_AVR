The question part on the top is a set of visual panels arranged in a 1 by 5 sequence, with the last piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?",
    "explanation": "Observing the shape of the question stem, we can see that there are 0, 1, 2, and 3 dotted characters in the first four shapes respectively. According to this rule, it can be deduced that there should be 4 dotted letters in the shape of the question mark. Then observe the options. It can be seen that item D is consistent with the meaning of the question.",
