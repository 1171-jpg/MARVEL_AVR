The question part on the top is a set of visual panels arranged in a 1 by 4 sequence, with the last piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?",
    "explanation": "The appearance of small black dots suggests considering functional elements and examining the positional relationships between the dots and other elements. Upon observation, it is noted that all black dots only appear at the acute angles of the shapes. Options A and B have small black dots at the right angles, option C has a small black dot at the obtuse angle, eliminating options A, B, and C.",
