The question part on the top is a set of visual panels arranged in a 1 by 5 sequence, with the last piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?",
    "explanation": "The third shape in the question exhibits a change in elements, hence ruling out a translation relationship. Upon observing the positional relationships of the four shapes, it is noted that each shape contains a tangential figure, and all four shapes include at least one set of externally tangent figures. The only option that conforms to this positional relationship is option C.",
