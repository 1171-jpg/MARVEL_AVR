    "Question": "Is the circle at the left or right part of candidate 1?",
    "Distrator": "right",
    "Perception_Answer": "left",
    "Demonstration": "The puzzle features a 3x2 grid of lines and circles, where each grid follows a specific pattern based on logical operations on the shapes within. The third grid in each row results from a logical operation on the shapes in the first two grids.\nIn the first row:\nThe first grid has three vertical lines.\nThe second grid has one vertical line in the middle.\nThe third grid has no vertical lines, obtained by subtracting the middle line in the second grid from the lines in the first grid.\nFollowing the same pattern for the second row:\nThe first grid has three circles.\nThe second grid has one circle in the middle.\nTherefore, the third grid should have two circles, obtained by subtracting the middle circle in the second grid from the circles in the first grid. The answer is choice 3.",
