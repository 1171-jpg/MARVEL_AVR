    "Explanation": "The element composition is the same, and the positional rules are given priority. As shown in the figure below, black point 1 moves one space clockwise in the outermost circle from the first shape to the fifth shape, and black point 2 moves circularly to the lower right along the diagonal line, from the first shape to the fifth shape. The fifth figure moves one space in turn. Then the black point 1 in the figure should appear in the fourth row and second column, and the black point 2 should appear in the second row and second column.",
