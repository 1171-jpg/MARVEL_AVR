    "Question": "Does the triangle intersect with the rectangle in candidate 4?",
    "Distrator": "no",
    "Perception_Answer": "yes",
    "Demonstration": "The puzzle showcases a sequence of shapes, each interacting with a square. The key to this puzzle is recognizing how each distinct geometric shape overlaps with a square in every grid.\nIn the sequence provided:\nThe first grid displays a circle overlapping with the square.\nThe second grid shows a square overlapping with the square.\nThe third grid features a triangle overlapping with the square.\nThe fourth grid should continue this pattern of geometric shapes overlapping with the square.\nTherefore, the missing grid should depict a geometric shape overlapping with the square. The choice 4 is the correct answer, as it shows a triangle overlapping with the square, consistent with the pattern of shapes interacting with squares in the sequence.",
