    "Explanation": "In the first column, from bottom to top, in the three figures, the numbers of line segments outside the figure are 1, 3, and 5 respectively, which is an arithmetic sequence; in the second column, from top to bottom, in the three figures, the number of line segments outside the figure are The numbers are 7, 9, and 11 respectively, which is an arithmetic sequence; in the third column, from bottom to top, in the three graphics, the numbers of line segments outside the graphics are (13), 15, and 17, which is an arithmetic sequence. Only the number of line segments protruding outside the graph of item A is 13. Therefore the correct answer is A.",
