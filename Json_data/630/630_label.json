    "Distrator": "no",
    "Perception_Answer": "yes",
    "Demonstration": "he puzzle displays a 3x2 grids where each row of grid features pairs of similar objects with varying interactions.\nIn the top row:\nThe first gird shows two interacting circles.\nThe second gird contains two interacting squares.\nThe third gird has two interacting triangles.\nIn the bottom row:\nThe first gird exhibits two interacting curve lines.\nThe second gird displays two interacting zigzag lines.\nSince the top row progresses with shapes that interacts with each other, the bottom row seems to follow the same pattern with lines. The correct answer is choice 1, with two interacting curve lines.",
