The question part on the top is a set of visual panels arranged in a 1 by 4 sequence, with the last piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?",
    "explanation": "The element composition is different, and the attribute rules are given priority. Question: Each picture is composed of straight lines and curves. Exclude item A. Continue to observe and find that each picture has only one curve. Exclude item B. Compare items C and D. It is found that the number of straight lines in item C is more than the number of curves. D The number of straight lines in the item is equal to the number of curves, and the figures in the question all have more straight lines than curves, so item D is excluded.",
