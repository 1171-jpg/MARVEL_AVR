The question part on the top is a set of visual grids arranged in a 3 by 3 matrix, with the bottom right piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?",
    "explanation": "The elements are similar in composition and the same lines appear repeatedly. Priority is given to addition, subtraction, similarities and differences. In the first line, the same lines are removed from the first picture and the second picture, and different lines are retained, and the third picture is obtained. The second line verifies that this rule is true, and the third line applies this rule, and only item B is true.",
