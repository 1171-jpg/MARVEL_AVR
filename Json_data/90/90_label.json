    "Explanation": "Observing the shapes, it is found that each image contains a circle, and it is observed that the circle intersects with another shape. Upon further observation, the relationships between the shapes in the question are respectively intersection, tangent, and intersection. Thus, at the question mark, a shape with a tangent relationship should be selected, and only option D fits this pattern.",
