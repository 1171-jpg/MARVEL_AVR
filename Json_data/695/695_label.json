    "Demonstration": "The pattern in the given sequence focuses on the number and relative positions of endpoints in each shape:\nThe first image is a straight line, which has two endpoints.\nThe second image is a triangle, which has three endpoints.\nThe third image is a square, which has four endpoints.\nThe fourth image is a pentagon, which has five endpoints.\nTherefore, to complete the pattern, the next image should be a shape with six endpoints. The choice 1 contains a hexagon, which has six endpoints.",
