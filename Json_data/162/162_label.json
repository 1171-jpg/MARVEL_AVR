The question part on the top is a set of visual grids arranged in a 3 by 1 sequence, with the last piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Based on a specific pattern, one option in the choice section can be classified into the same group as the question part, while the other three options are categorized into a different group. Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?",
    "explanation": "The question stem graphics are composed of an outer frame and 3 lines inside. The overall number line is different, which cannot be grouped. After careful observation, we found that there are multiple single straight lines and single curves inside each graph. You can consider counting the number of straight lines and curves inside the graph separately. There are 3 curves inside one group and there are 2 curves inside anothe group.",
