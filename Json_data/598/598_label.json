    "Question": "Are the arrows in candidate 3 pointing to left/right or top/down?",
    "Distrator": "left/right",
    "Perception_Answer": "top/down",
    "Demonstration": "The sequence depicts an arrow initially positioned on the left side of a single square, pointing vertically upwards and downwards. In each subsequent step, the arrow progressively moves from left to right without rotating or changing its vertical up-down orientation.\nThe progression of the sequence is as follows:\n1. Arrow starts on the far left side of the square, pointing vertically.\n2. Arrow moves slightly rightwards, still outside the square and pointing vertically.\n3. Arrow continues moving right, now positioned inside the left side of the square, still pointing vertically.\n4. Arrow moves further right, now inside the square closer to the center, maintaining vertical orientation.\n5. Arrow has moved all the way to the right side of the square, still pointing vertically up and down.\nTherefore, to conclude and complete this pattern sequence, the missing element should show the arrow having moved beyond the right side of the square while maintaining its consistent vertical up-down orientation throughout the progression. The correct answer is the image in choice 1.",
