    "Explanation": "The graphic elements of the question stem have different compositions and no obvious attribute rules. Consider the quantity rules. The graphics in the first row have 2, 3, and 1 faces respectively, and the graphics in the second row have 0, 3, and 3 faces respectively. The sum of the number of faces in the first shape and the third shape in each row is equal. The number of faces of the two shapes. The third figure in the row has 1, 3, and 3 faces respectively, so the figure at the question mark should have 2 faces, excluding three items A, B, and D.",
