    "Question": "Is candidate 1 symmetrical along the horizontal or vertical axis?",
    "Distrator": "horizontal",
    "Perception_Answer": "vertical",
    "Demonstration": "The puzzle features a 3x2 grid of lines and rectangles, where each grid follows a specific pattern based on logical operations on the shapes within, considering their locations. The third grid in each row results from a logical operation on the shapes in the first two grids.\nIn the first row:\nThe first grid has two lines, one on the left and one on the right.\nThe second grid has the right line from the first grid.\nThe third grid has the left line, obtained by subtracting the right line in the second grid from the two lines in the first grid.\nFollowing the same pattern for the second row:\nThe first grid has two rectangles, one on the left and one on the right.\nThe second grid has the right rectangle from the first grid.\nTherefore, the third grid should have the left rectangle, obtained by subtracting the left rectangle in the second grid from the two rectangles in the first grid. Choice 3 is correct.",
