    "Explanation": "Each row of the nine-square grid has black and white circles, as well as a rectangle, a trapezoid, and a triangle. Therefore, there is still a trapezoid missing in the third row, excluding item A. Comparing the three items B, C, and D, we found that the positions of the black and white circles are different. Observing the positions of the black and white circles in the question stem, we found that there are three positions of the black and white circles in each row: all inside the polygon, all outside the polygon, and the white circle is inside the polygon. The black circle is on the outside, and the third line lacks the situation of one inside and one outside. Therefore, the figure at the question mark should be that the white circle is inside and the black circle is outside, so the answer is B.",
