    "Question": "Are the two heart shape in candidate 4 intersected or separated?",
    "Distrator": "separated",
    "Perception_Answer": "intersected",
    "Demonstration": "The pattern in the given sequence involves shapes consisting of two identical shapes that are symmetrical about the diagonal axes:\nThe first grid shows two overlapping circles, which is symmetrical about the diagonal axes.\nThe second grid contains two overlapping triangles, which is symmetrical about the diagonal axes.\nThe third grid features two overlapping squares, which is symmetrical about the diagonal axes.\nThe fourth grid displays two overlapping pentagon, which is symmetrical about the diagonal axes.\nFollowing this pattern, the next grid should display two identical shapes that are symmetrical about the diagonal axes. Therefore, the correct answer is choice 2, which shows two identical heart shapes overlapping and symmetrically arranged about their diagonals",
