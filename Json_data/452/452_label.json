    "Explanation": "The correctness of the question stem graphics is different. In the first set of figures, the straightness of the figures is in the order of: curve + straight line, curve + straight line, straight line; in the second set of figures, the straightness of the figures is in the order of: curve + straight line, curve + straight line. Therefore, it should be a fully straight line graph, and only item D is consistent.",
