    "Explanation": "The first, third and fifth figures all differ by 1 circle, and there is an obvious arithmetic relationship. The second and fourth figures should also differ by 1 circle, and the difference in the figures is 2 moons, indicating that 1 Circles = 2 moons. The five figures can be regarded as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 moons. The next figure should be 6 moons or 3 circles. Only item C conforms to this rule.",
