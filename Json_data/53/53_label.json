    "Answer": "D",
    "Pattern": "Attribute Pattern",
    "Sub-Pattern": "straightness, opening and closing",
    "Explanation": "The composition of elements is different, and the attribute rules are given priority. For nine-square grid graphics, first look at the horizontal rows. The first row is a straight-line graphic, the second row is a full-curve graphic, the first graphic and the second graphic in the third row are both \"straight + curved\" graphics, so the graphic at the question mark should also be \"straight + curved\" figure, exclude items B and C. Continuing to observe, we found that all the figures in the question are closed figures, and only item D is consistent.",
