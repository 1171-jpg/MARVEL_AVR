    "Explanation": "In the first row, the rotation-like curves rotate clockwise, counterclockwise, and clockwise from the outside to the inside. In the second row, the rotation-like curves rotate counterclockwise, clockwise, and counterclockwise from the outside to the inside. In the third row, the two small figures in the front are rotating curves from the outside to the inside, rotating clockwise and counterclockwise respectively. Then, the rotation-like curve of the third small figure should be clockwise from the outside to the inside, and only item A is consistent. Therefore the correct answer is A.",
