    "Explanation": "This question is a nine-square grid question. The element composition is messy, consider the attribute rules. The Nine Officials Grid can be thought about horizontally first and then vertically. It is observed that the first horizontal row is composed of straight lines, the second horizontal row is composed of curves, and the two pictures given in the third horizontal row have curves and straight lines. Fill in the question marks The graph should also contain both straight lines and curves, thus excluding items A and C. Comparing the differences between items B and D, it is found that item B is composed of one part and item D is composed of two parts. Each picture in the question is a part, so item D is excluded accordingly. Therefore the correct answer is B.",
