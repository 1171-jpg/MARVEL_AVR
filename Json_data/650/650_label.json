    "Demonstration": "The puzzle showcases a sequence of shapes. The key to this puzzle is combining the shapes from the first two grids into the third grid.\nIn the first row provided:\nThe first grid contains a rectangle on the top part.\nThe second grid contains a rectangle on the bottom part.\nThe third grid is the combination of the first two grids, with rectangles on both the top and bottom parts.\nIn the second row:\nThe first grid contains a circle on the top part.\nThe second grid contains a circle on the bottom part.\nTherefore, the missing grid should contain the combination of circles from the first two grids. The choice 1 is the correct answer, as it shows two circles, incorporating the one circle from the first grid and one circle from the second grid.",
