    "Explanation": "The elements have different compositions and no obvious attribute rules. Consider the quantity rules. It is observed that the intersections of the graph lines are obvious. Considering the number of intersection points, the number of intersection points of the graphs in the question is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,?, so the question mark should be filled in with a graph with 8 intersection points.",
