The question part on the top is a set of visual panels arranged in a 2 by 3 matrix, with the bottom right piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?",
    "explanation": "The composition of elements is similar, prioritizing the consideration of style patterns. The number of black blocks in the question shapes varies, prompting consideration of black and white computation. Observing the first set of shapes reveals the following pattern: black + black = black, white + black = white, black + blank = white, white + white = black. Following this rule, the only option that conforms to the answer is option C.",
