The question part on the top is a set of visual panels arranged in a 1 by 6 sequence, with the last piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?",
    "explanation": "The elements have different compositions and no obvious attribute rules. Consider the quantity rules. The outer frames of the graphics are all polygons and there are many internal lines. You can give priority to the number of faces and lines, but there are no rules. Continue to observe and find that there are intersections between the internal lines of the graphics and the outer frame. You can consider the number of intersections and the intersection points of the figures in the question. The numbers are 4, 567, and 8 in order, showing an increasing pattern of numbers, so a graph with a number of intersections of 9 should be selected. The number of intersection points of item A is 7, the number of intersection points of item B is 10, the number of intersection points of item C is 9, the number of intersection points of item D is 8, and only item C is consistent.",
