    "explanation": "The composition of graphic elements is similar, prioritizing the consideration of style patterns. Since the middle symbol in the second set of images is in the center, let's first observe how the second image in the first set is obtained from the first and third images. The first and third images are compared to identify similarities and differences. Then, the result is obtained by rotating counterclockwise by 90\u00b0 to get the second image. The same pattern is observed in the second set.",
