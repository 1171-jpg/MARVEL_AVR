    "Explanation": "The element composition is different, and the attribute rules are given priority. Observation found that characteristic diagrams such as arrows and isosceles triangles appeared in the questions. Consider symmetry. Observation found that each figure in the question stem is both an axially symmetrical figure and a centrally symmetrical figure. Among the four options, item A is only a centrally symmetrical figure, items C and D are only axially symmetrical figures, and only item B is both an axially symmetrical figure and a centrally symmetrical figure.",
