    "Perception_Answer": "three",
    "Demonstration": "The pattern in the given sequence is that the number of stripped shapes increases by 1 in each consecutive image.:\nIn the first row:\nThe first image contains two white rectangles and one stripped rectangle.\nThe second image contains one white rectangles and two stripped rectangles.\nThe third image contains three stripped rectangles.\nIn the second row:\nThe first image contains two white flag-like shapes and one dash flag-like shape.\nThe second image contains one white flag-like shapes and two dash flag-like shapes.\nTherefore, the third image should contain three dash flag-like shapes, which is the choice 3.",
