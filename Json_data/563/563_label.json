    "Question": "Is the triangle at the leftmost or rightmost corner of candidate 4 filled in black?",
    "Distrator": "leftmost",
    "Perception_Answer": "rightmost",
    "Demonstration": "To solve this puzzle, we have to visualize how the unfolded diagram of the regular tetrahedron would look when it's folded into the three-dimensional shape. Each triangle in the question part is a face of the tetrahedron.\nThe correct choice will be the one where the triangles in the unfolded diagram can be folded back together without incorrect face direction or placement.\nLooking at the choices provided:\nIn choice 1, the direction of the black triangle on the right face of tetrahedron is incorrect.\nIn choice 2, the direction of two lines on the left face of tetrahedron is incorrect.\nIn choice 3, the direction and placement of two faces of tetrahedron are correct.\nIn choice 4, the direction of two lines on the left face of tetrahedron is incorrect.\nTherefore, the correct choice is choice 3.",
