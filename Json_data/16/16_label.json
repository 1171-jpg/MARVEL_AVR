The question part on the top is a set of visual panels arranged in a 1 by 5 sequence, with the last piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?",
    "explanation": "Observe the graphics, the elements have the same composition, and consider the positional relationship. The hour hand (the shortest arrow) moves 1-2-3 squares clockwise each time, and should move 4 squares at ?, excluding item A. The needle (head) moves 2-3-4 squares clockwise each time, and the ? should move 5 squares and cannot be ruled out. The second hand (long thin arrow) moves 3-4-5 squares clockwise each time, and should move 6 squares at ?, excluding items C and D, corresponding to item B",
