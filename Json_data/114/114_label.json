The question part on the top is a set of visual panels arranged in a 1 by 5 sequence, with the last piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?",
    "explanation": "The element composition is the same, and the positional rules are given priority. Observing the small black dots, we found that the rule is to translate one space clockwise at a time, so the small black dots at the question marks should appear below, excluding items A and B. Observe the gray triangle again and find that the rule is to move one space clockwise at a time, so the gray triangle at the question mark should appear on the right, excluding item D",
