The question part on the top is a set of visual panels arranged in a 1 by 6 sequence, with the last piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?",
    "explanation": "The symmetry axes of the first, third and fifth pictures do not coincide with the lines inside the figure, while the symmetry axes of the second picture and the fourth picture all coincide with a line inside the figure, so the question mark To fill in a figure whose symmetry axis coincides with the internal lines of the figure, only item C is satisfied.",
