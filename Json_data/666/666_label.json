    "Question": "Are the bottom squares in candidate 3 filled in dash or white?",
    "Distrator": "white",
    "Perception_Answer": "dash",
    "Demonstration": "The puzzle features a 3x2 grid with circles and squares, where each grid follows a specific pattern based on logical operations on the colors of the shapes within. The third grid in each row results from changing the color of shapes based on their colors in the first two grids.\nIn the first row:\nThe first grid has four circles, two dash on the left and top, and two white on the bottom and right.\nThe second grid has four circles, one dash on the left, and three white on the top, bottom and left.\nThe third grid has four circles, with the colors determined as follows:\nShapes that were dash in both the first and second grids become white.\nShapes that were white in both the first and second grids become white.\nShapes that were dash in one grid and white in the other remain dash.\nFollowing the same pattern for the second row:\nThe first grid has three squares, two dash on the left and top, and one white in the right.\nThe second grid has three squares, one dash on the left, and two white on the top and right.\nTherefore, the third grid should have three squares, with the colors determined by the same color pattern in first row. Choice 1 has three squares with one dash on the top and two white on the left and right, so it is the most appropriate answer.",
