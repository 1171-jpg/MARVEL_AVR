    "Question": "Is the black filled circle inside or outside of the cloud shape in candidate 2?",
    "Distrator": "outside",
    "Perception_Answer": "inside",
    "Demonstration": "In this puzzle, each grid contains both a black circle and a white circle. The pattern dictates that the black circle is always outside the geometric shape, and the white circle is always inside the shape.\nIn the sequence provided:\nThe first grid shows a black circle outside and a white circle inside a trapezoid.\nThe second grid shows a black circle outside and a white circle inside a square.\nThe third grid shows a black circle outside and a white circle inside a triangle.\nThe third grid shows a black circle outside and a white circle inside a rectangle.\nThe fifth grid should feature a black circle with a white circle inside a geometric shape. The correct answer is choice 4, as it shows a black circle outside and a white circle inside the cloud-like shape, consistent with the pattern in the sequence.",
