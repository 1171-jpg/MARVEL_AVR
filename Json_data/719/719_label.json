    "Question": "Are all lines inside of the circle in candidate 3 or not?",
    "Distrator": "no",
    "Perception_Answer": "yes",
    "Demonstration": "The pattern in the given sequence is that the number of closed sectors increases with each step:\nThe first grid contains a circle with one vertical line, forming two closed sectors.\nThe second grid contains a circle with two lines that form three closed sectors.\nThe third grid contains a circle with three lines that form four closed sectors.\nThe fourth grid contains a circle with four lines that form five closed sectors.\nTherefore, to complete the pattern, the next grid should contain a circle with five lines, forming six closed sectors, which is choice 3.",
