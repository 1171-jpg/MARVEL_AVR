    "Perception_Answer": "three",
    "Demonstration": "The pattern in the given sequence is that the number of intersection points of lines in each row increases by one.\nLet's analyze the pattern in the given rows:\nIn the first row:\nIn the first image, all curve lines intersecting at one point.\nIn the second image, all curve lines intersecting at two point.\nIn the third image, all curve lines intersecting at three point.\nIn the second row:\nIn the first image, all lines intersecting at one point.\nIn the second image, all lines intersecting at two point.\nThe third image should contain three lines intersecting at three point. Therefore the correct answer is choice 1.",
