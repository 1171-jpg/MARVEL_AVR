    "Sub-Pattern": "Black and white computation",
    "Explanation": "The composition of graphic elements is similar, prioritizing the consideration of style patterns. Upon observation, it is noted that the shapes in the question are composed of black and white dots, suggesting consideration of black and white computation. Based on the first row, the computation pattern is as follows: black + black = white, black + white = black, white + black = black, white + white = black. Upon verification of the second row, it conforms to this computation pattern. In the third row, the top-left corner results in white + white = black, eliminating options B and D. Comparing options A and C, the colors in the bottom-right corner are different, and it should be black + white = black, eliminating option A.",
