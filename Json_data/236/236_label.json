    "Explanation": "In the first row, the numbers of right angles in the three figures are 1 and 23 respectively. In the second line, the right angle numbers of the three figures are also 1, 2, and 3 respectively. This rule applies to the third line. The right angle numbers of the first two figures are 1 and 2 respectively. Therefore, a right angle number of 3 should be selected at the number. The numbers of right angles in the graph of item ABCD are 2, 0, 5, and 3 respectively, and only item D matches.",
