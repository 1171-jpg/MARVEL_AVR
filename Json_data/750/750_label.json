    "Demonstration": "The pattern in the given sequence is that the image in each row symmetrically about the same axes:\nIn the first row:\nThe first image is symmetrical about the vertical axis.\nThe second image is symmetrical about the vertical axis.\nThe third image is symmetrical about the vertical axis.\nIn the second row:\nThe first image is symmetrical about the horizontal axis.\nThe second image is symmetrical about the horizontal axis.\nTherefore, the third image should also have be symmetrical about the horizontal axis. The choice 3 is the correct answer.",
