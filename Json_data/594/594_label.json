    "Explanation": "Neighbor graphics aim at the difference. It is observed that the positions of the white circle and the triangle in Figures 1 and 2 are reversed; the positions of the white circle and the plus sign in Figures 2 and 3 are reversed; and the positions of the white circle and the black circle in Figures 3 and 4 are reversed. To summarize the rules: adjacent graphics have two elements whose positions are reversed. According to this rule, the correct answer is option C. The positions of the white circle and the square are reversed.",
