The question part on the top is a set of visual grids arranged in a 3 by 3 matrix, with the bottom right piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?",
    "explanation": "Each row of the nine-square grid has black and white circles, as well as a rectangle, a trapezoid, and a triangle. Therefore, there is still a trapezoid missing in the third row. There are three positions of the black and white circles in each row: all inside the polygon, all outside the polygon, and the white circle is inside the polygon. ",
