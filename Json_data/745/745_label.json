    "Demonstration": "The pattern in the given sequence is that each shape displayed is symmetrical:\nThe first grid shows a triangle, which is symmetrical about its ertical axes.\nThe second grid shows a rectangle, which is symmetrical about both its horizontal and vertical axes.\nThe third grid shows a circle, which is symmetrical about any diameter.\nThe fourth grid shows a pentagon, which is symmetrical.\nTo continue this pattern, the fifth grid should contain a shape that is symmetrical. Therefore, the correct answer is choice 1, which shows a shape that is symmetrical about multiple axes.",
