The question part on the top is a set of visual panels arranged in a 1 by 4 sequence, with the last piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?",
    "explanation": "Observing the shapes in the question, each image has a black circle and a white circle, both located in two different regions. Additionally, the region where the white circle is located is larger than the region where the black circle is located, eliminating option A. Further observation reveals that all shapes in the question have 3 surfaces, whereas option B has 4 surfaces, and option C has 7 surfaces, eliminating options B and C.",
