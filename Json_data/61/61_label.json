The question part on the top is a set of visual panels arranged in a 1 by 6 sequence, with the last piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?",
    "explanation": "The composition of elements is different, and the attribute rules are given priority. The question is that the figure is relatively regular. Consider the axis symmetry and observe the number of symmetry axes. The question stems from the question. It is known that the number of symmetry axes of the figure is 2, 1, 2, 1, 3. There is no obvious attribute rule. Consider the quantity rule. Observing the question stem graphics again, we found that the first and fifth pictures show circles intersecting circles\", which is the characteristic map of the number of strokes. The known number of strokes in the question stem is 1,1,2,2,1. No rules. If the lines of the question line intersect obviously, consider the number of intersection points. The number of intersections of the shapes in the question stem is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ?, that is, the shape with the number of intersections 7 should be selected at the number. The number of intersection points of the graphs of item ABCD is 18, 8, 7, and 8, and item C is consistent.\"",
