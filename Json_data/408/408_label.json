    "Answer": "C",

    "Sub-Pattern": "Parallel Movement",
    "Explanation": "It is observed that the first column in the first row of graphics decreases by one circle from bottom to top; the second column in the second row of graphics decreases by one circle from bottom to top; and the third column in the third row of graphics decreases by one circle in sequence. . The order is regular, so items B and D are eliminated: observing the movement pattern of the small black circle, we can see that the small black circle moves two spaces at a time. If there is no circle on the right, move to the next row and exclude item A. Therefore the correct answer is C.",
