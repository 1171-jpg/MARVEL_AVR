The question part on the top is a set of visual panels arranged in a 1 by 5 sequence, with the last piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?",
    "explanation": "The composition of the shapes is different, and each is formed by two elements, both of which have intersecting portions. Considering the relationship between shapes, in the question, the intersection of the two elements forms a third surface. Option A involves overlapping, so it is eliminated. Option B is not composed of two elements, so it is excluded. Option D involves overlapping, so it is excluded.",
