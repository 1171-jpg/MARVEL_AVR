The question part on the top is a set of visual panels arranged in a 1 by 6 sequence, with the last piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?",
    "explanation": "The composition of each figure is different, the elements are messy, and there is no obvious attribute rule. Considering the quantity rule, it is found that the number of intersections of the figures in the question stem are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively, forming an arithmetic sequence. Among the four items of ABCD The number of intersection points of the graph are 8, 6, 10, 8 respectively.",
