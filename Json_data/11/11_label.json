    "Explanation": "The graphic elements have different compositions and no obvious attribute rules. Consider the quantity rules. It is observed that the circular frame and square of each figure have an intersection point, and the position of the intersection point is rotated 90\u00b0 counterclockwise. Therefore, the intersection point in the figure at the question mark should be on the right side, and only item D is consistent. Moreover, the number of intersection points of triangles and squares in the figure at the bottom of the question is 0123, and the number of points in the sum of the shapes in the figure above should be 4. Item D also conforms to this rule.",
