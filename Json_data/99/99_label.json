The question part on the top is a set of visual panels arranged in a 1 by 5 sequence, with the last piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?",
    "explanation": "The element composition is the same, and the positional rules are given priority. Observing the graphics, we find that the small black blocks in the fourth row from the first width picture to the width picture are moved one space to the left, and the small black blocks in the third row from the second width picture to the third width picture are moved one space to the left in the third picture. The small black block in the second row of the fourth picture moves one space to the left. Therefore, when the fourth picture reaches the question mark, the small black block in the first row should move one space to the left. Only item B matches.",
