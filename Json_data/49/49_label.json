    "Explanation": "The element composition is messy. All the figures in the question are axially symmetrical figures with a unique number of symmetry axes. Consider symmetry. In the question, the axis of symmetry rotates 45\u00b0 counterclockwise each time. Accordingly, exclude C and two more items. There are no other obvious attribute rules. Consider the quantity rules. The four pictures in the question are all composed of straight lines. A polygon-like shape and a single straight line appear simultaneously. Considering the number of straight lines, each picture is composed of 5 straight lines. The number of straight lines in items A and B is 5 and 6 respectively. Accordingly, item A is eliminated. Therefore the correct answer is B.",
