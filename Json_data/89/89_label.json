The question part on the top is a set of visual grids arranged in a 3 by 3 matrix, with the bottom right piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?",
    "explanation": "Observing the shapes, it can be seen that each shape is composed of two elements. Additionally, the static positional relationships between the two elements in each row are intersection, tangent, and separation. In the question shapes, there are both black and white elements, and only option D satisfies this pattern.",
