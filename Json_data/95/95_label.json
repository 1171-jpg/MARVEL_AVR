    "Explanation": "The third shape in the question exhibits a change in elements, hence ruling out a translation relationship. Upon observing the positional relationships of the four shapes, it is noted that each shape contains a tangential figure, and all four shapes include at least one set of externally tangent figures. The only option that conforms to this positional relationship is option C.",
