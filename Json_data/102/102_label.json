The question part on the top is a set of visual panels arranged in a 1 by 6 sequence, with the last piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?",
    "explanation": "It was observed that there are 7 black circles whose positions remain unchanged between the first picture and the second picture. Continue to observe that the positions of the 7 black circles between the two adjacent pictures of the question stem remain unchanged. Item A has only 6 positions that remain unchanged, item B satisfies the 7 black circle positions that remain unchanged, item C only has 6 positions that remain unchanged, and item D only has 5 positions that remain unchanged.",
