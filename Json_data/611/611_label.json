    "Demonstration": "The given puzzle presents a sequence of five triangular shapes, with the last shape missing. The objective is to identify the pattern in the sequence and determine which of the four choices would logically complete it.\nLet's analyze the pattern in the given sequence:\nThe first shape in the sequence is an equilateral triangle pointing upwards.\nIn the second shape, the triangle is rotated 90 degrees clockwise, now pointing to the right.\nThe third shape shows the triangle rotated another 90 degrees clockwise, pointing downwards.\nIn the fourth shape, the triangle is again rotated 90 degrees clockwise, pointing to the left.\nBased on this pattern, we can conclude that the triangle is rotating 90 degrees clockwise in each step of the sequence.\nTo determine the missing shape, we need to continue the pattern by rotating the triangle 90 degrees clockwise from its position in the fourth shape.\nLooking at the provided choices, choice 3 accurately represents the expected shape. It shows the triangle pointing upwards, which is the result of rotating the left-pointing triangle from the fourth shape by 90 degrees clockwise.",
