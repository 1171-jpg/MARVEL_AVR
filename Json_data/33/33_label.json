The question part on the top is a set of visual grids arranged in a 3 by 3 matrix, with the bottom right piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?",
    "explanation": "The composition of elements is similar, and identical lines are repeated, prioritizing considerations of addition, subtraction, similarity, and difference in the style pattern. When observing the tic-tac-toe grid, prioritize examining it row by row. In the first row, the third image is obtained by differentiating the first and second images and then rotating clockwise or counterclockwise by 90\u00b0. After verification, the second row also follows this pattern. Applying the same pattern to the third row, the shape at the question mark should be one obtained by first differentiating the first and second images, then rotating clockwise or counterclockwise by 90\u00b0. Upon observation of the options, it is found that there is no answer for counterclockwise rotation by 90\u00b0, but option D can be obtained by clockwise rotation by 90\u00b0.",
