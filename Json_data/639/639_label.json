    "Distrator": "outside",
    "Perception_Answer": "inside",
    "Demonstration": "The puzzle showcases a sequence of grids, each containing two similar geometric shapes, with a black heart symbol consistently placed within the larger one of the two shapes.\nIn the sequence provided:\nThe first grid has a large square with a black heart and a smaller square without a heart.\nThe second grid features a large triangle with a black heart and a smaller triangle without a heart.\nThe third grid contains a large circle with a black heart and a smaller circle without a heart.\nThe fourth grid contains a large trapezoid with a black heart and a smaller trapezoid without a heart.\nThe choice that follows this pattern is choice 1, as it shows a large hexagon with a black heart and a smaller hexagon without a heart, maintaining the sequence established by the previous grids.",
