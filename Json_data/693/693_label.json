    "Perception_Answer": "four",
    "Demonstration": "Let's analyze the pattern in the given sequence:\nThe first image contains a single horizontal line.\nThe second image contains a horizontal line intersected by one vertical line, creating one intersection point.\nThe third image contains a horizontal line intersected by two vertical lines, creating two intersection points.\nThe fourth image contains a horizontal line intersected by three vertical lines, creating three intersection points.\nTherefore, the fourth image should contain a horizontal line intersected by four vertical lines, creating four intersection points, only choice 1 follow the pattern.",
