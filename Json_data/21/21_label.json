From the third picture to the fourth picture, From the fourth picture to the fifth picture, the white L shape is rotated 90\" counterclockwise, the black L shape remains unchanged, and there is a small black square overlapping the small white square, showing black. According to the above rules, from the fifth picture to The figure at the question mark should be a black L shape rotated 90\u00b0 clockwise, and the position of the white L shape remains unchanged, corresponding to item A",
