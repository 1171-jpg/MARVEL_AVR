    "Explanation": "The three figures in the first row, the number of closed parts are 3, 2, 3 respectively. 3+2+3=8; the three figures in the second row, the number of closed parts are 1, 3, 4 respectively. 1+ 3+4=8; according to this rule, the sum of the numbers of the closed parts of the three figures in the third row should be 8. The number of closed parts of the first shape in the third row is 3, and the number of closed parts of the second shape is 4. The number of closed parts of the third shape should be 1. Therefore, the answer should be A.",
