    "Demonstration": "The given puzzle presents a sequence of shapes where a circle and a line flip vertically. The objective is to identify the missing shape that would logically complete the pattern.\nLet's analyze the pattern in the given sequence:\nIn the first image, the line goes from the top-left to the bottom-right.\nIn the second image, the line goes from the top-right to the bottom-left, which could be seen as a vertical flip of the first image.\nThe third image again has the line from the top-left to the bottom-right.\nThe fourth image repeats the pattern with the line from the top-right to the bottom-left, like a vertical flip of the third image.\nBased on the alternating vertical flip pattern, the missing fifth symbol should have the line going from the top-left to the bottom-right because it would be a vertical flip of the fourth image, which is the choice 3.",
