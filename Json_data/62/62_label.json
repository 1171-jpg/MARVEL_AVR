    "Explanation": "The shape of the black part of the figure given in the question is a hexagon, a pentagon, a quadrilateral and a triangle. The number of sides of the figure decrease by one, so the black part of the figure at the question mark should be a figure with two sides. Exclude two items C and D, compare two items A and B, and find that the number of sides of the small shapes located in the upper left and lower left of the black part are different. Looking at the question stem, we can see that the number of sides of the small shapes in the given shape is 5, 4, and 3 in order. , 2. The number of sides of the small figures also decreases in sequence, so the number of sides of the small figures in the figure at the question mark should be 1, and only item A is consistent.",
