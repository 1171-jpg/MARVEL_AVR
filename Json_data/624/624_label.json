    "Question": "Does the line intersect with the triangle in candidate 2?",
    "Distrator": "yes",
    "Perception_Answer": "no",
    "Demonstration": "The puzzle showcases a sequence of shapes, each intersected by a horizontal line. The key to this puzzle is identifying that each shape has a line going through it, regardless of the position of the line.\nIn the sequence provided:\nThe first shape is a circle with a line going through it horizontally.\nThe second shape is a square with a line going through it horizontally.\nThe third shape is a triangle with a line going through it horizontally.\nThe fourth shape is a rectangle with a line going through it horizontally.\nThe fifth shape is missing and needs to be identified.\nTherefore, the missing grid should contain a shape with a line going through it horizontally. The choice that fits this pattern is Choice 1, as it depicts a shape with a horizontal line going through it, consistent with the rest of the sequence. The choice 1 is the correct answer.",
