    "Answer": "B",
    "Pattern": "Attribute Pattern",
    "Sub-Pattern": "symmetry",
    "Explanation": "In the first row, the symmetry axis of the graph is rotated 45\u00b0 clockwise, so the graph at the question mark should have an axis of symmetry tilted 45\u00b0 to the right, excluding A and C. Observing the graph again, we find that in the first line, the axis of symmetry in the odd-numbered graph coincides with a certain line segment of the graph, and the symmetry axis in the even-numbered graph does not coincide with any line segment in the graph. The rule is reversed in the second line",
