    "Explanation": "The composition of the elements is messy and the quantity is a question. It can be seen that lines can be straight or curved, considering the number of intersections. Observed from left to right, the number of intersections of various lines in the graph is 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The next graph should be a graph with 7 intersections. Observe that only the number of line intersections of the graph in item A is 7.",
