    "avr_question": "You are given a puzzle. The puzzle consists of a question part on the top and the choices part in the bottom. The question part on the top is a set of visual panels arranged in a 1 by 5 sequence, with the last piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?",
    "explanation": "The element composition is messy. All the figures in the question are axially symmetrical figures with a unique number of symmetry axes. Consider symmetry. In the question, the axis of symmetry rotates 45\u00b0 counterclockwise each time. Accordingly, exclude C and two more items. There are no other obvious attribute rules. Consider the quantity rules. The four pictures in the question are all composed of straight lines. A polygon-like shape and a single straight line appear simultaneously. Considering the number of straight lines, each picture is composed of 5 straight lines. The number of straight lines in items A and B is 5 and 6 respectively. Accordingly, item A is eliminated. Therefore the correct answer is B.",
